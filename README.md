## ðŸŒŒ About

This project is an exciting blend of **Augmented Reality (AR)** technology and **Shoe Fashion**, creating a **Virtual Try-On** experience. Powered by a state-of-the-art **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model, our system brings a unique and interactive way to try on shoes virtually. Inspired by the paper "AR Shoe: Real-Time Augmented Reality Shoe Try-on System on Smartphones," we developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that was showcased at the Datathon Vietnam competition.

## âœ¨ What is it?

Our project is an **AR Shoe Try-On System** that allows users to virtually try on shoes using their smartphones. The system uses AR technology to overlay shoes onto the userâ€™s feet in real time, creating an immersive and interactive experience. This project is designed for anyone interested in the fusion of fashion and technology, particularly those in the retail or e-commerce industry looking to enhance customer engagement.


## ðŸ¤” Why did we do it?

The primary goal of this project was to explore the potential of AR in transforming the shopping experience. By integrating AR with a CNN model, we aimed to provide users with a realistic and engaging way to try on shoes virtually, reducing the need for physical try-ons and enhancing online shopping.

## ðŸ§© How did we do it?

### 1. **Technology Stack**:
   - **AR Technology**: Utilized to create the real-time shoe try-on experience.
   - **CNN Model**: Implemented to accurately position and fit the virtual shoes on the userâ€™s feet.

### 2. **Development Process**:
   - **Inspiration**: Derived from the paper "AR Shoe: Real-Time Augmented Reality Shoe Try-on System on Smartphones."
   - **Model Training**: The CNN model was trained to recognize and overlay shoes onto the user's feet with precision.
   - **MVP Creation**: Developed a Minimum Viable Product that was successfully presented at the Datathon competition.
